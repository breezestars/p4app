# Implementing FPGA
fpga.config - the command to set flow in p4

command format:
table_add <table_name> <action> <match_field> => <parameters>...  <priority>

example:
table_add fpga decap 52:54:00:00:00:00&&&ff:ff:00:00:00:00 => 00:00:00:00:de:fa 2 20
Add flow to table "fpga" and the action is "decap".
The match filed is use ternary type so "52:54:00:00:00:00&&&ff:ff:00:00:00:00" means match the first 2 bytes "52:54".
"00:00:00:00:de:fa 2" in this example, "00:00:00:00:de:fa" is the OF switch's my MAC and 2 is the port which connect to OF sw.
"20" is the priority of this flow.

TODO:
1.Finish compute checksum.
2.Reduce the code those can reuse.

Hint:
[Decap]
When I replay the pcap file which contain GTP packets. I choose the docker0 as input interface so that switch will
  receive the packets and packets will get into the pipeline.
[Encap]
I connect 2 hosts with 1 switch(h1<-->s1<-->h2). I change the h1's MAC as specific address and ping h2 so that I can
  receive the GTP packets on h2.


action encap(bit<32> tunnel_DstIp, bit<32> tunnel_SrcIp, bit<16> identification,
               bit<8> dscp, bit<8> ttl, bit<16> udp_DstPort, bit<16> udp_SrcPort,
               bit<8> gtp_Flags, bit<8> gtp_msgType);
